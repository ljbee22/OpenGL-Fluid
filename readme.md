# OpenGL Fluid Simulation
This project implements real-time fluid simulation using SPH(Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics) and Screen Space Rendering.
The base code and library usage is referenced in [LearnOpenGL](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL). Check that documentation for requirements and dependency resolution.

## Linux building
The source directory is `project` and specify the build directory as `project/build`. You can build and run it with the commands below.
```
cd project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
./main
```
